# PyRVA Lecture Night

Welcome to the PyRVA lecture night repository. Lecture night is a monthly gathering where
PyRVA offers the floor to a speaker to demonstrate a specific topic or problem involving python.
Some presenters will choose to host their own code while others contribute their code to this repo.

Check us out on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyRVAUserGroup/) to see when the next meeting
is scheduled. **Due to current events, we are hosting virtual meetings on
[Discord](https://discord.com/). Invite links will be posted on Meetup.**
