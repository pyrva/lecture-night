# Notes

 - The first half of the talk (25 minutes) will cover basic git/github knowledge. 
 - The second half of the talk (25 minutes) will cover more python centralized knowledge (virtualenv, setup tools, pytest)
 - For those completely new to github/python, I recommend following along for the first half and using the second half of the talk to play around with your newfound knowledge.
 - Those who are more experienced with git/github can help out those new in the beginning.
